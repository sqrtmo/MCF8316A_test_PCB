# MCF8316A test board (KiCAD version)

This is meant to be an easy and cheaper way to test the MCF8316A chip. If you do not have access, 
or you don't want to buy the evaluation board from TI(see datasheet in doc subfolder), 
you can use this PCB in combiation with my micropython driver made for raspberry pi pico to setup and 
test the chip with your desired BLDC motor.
